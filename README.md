Code that has been used for the paper: Author clustering with the aid of a simple distance measure (http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1866/paper_95.pdf) and other algorithms are explained in my bachelor thesis (https://esc.fnwi.uva.nl/thesis/centraal/files/f1229195084.pdf). 

The experiments itself are not included, for those files, you can contact me. 

Most of the code (what it does) is partly explained in both papers, but with any confusion, you can also contact me.
